# Profile web application using the randomuser.me API

This project was my first introduction to Javascript, and was originally made for a job application, which I later decided not to proceed with.
The project uses an API to generate "profile cards" with random users, displaying an image, name, email on the front of the card, and more information such as location on the back of the card.
There is also a map function integrated, that shows the location of every user. Note that these locations are randomly generated, and most of them are therefore in odd places such as the middle of the ocean.
For this the google maps API is used.
